Ethercis
========

**v1.2.0 June 2018**

What is it?
-----------

An [openEHR](http://www.openehr.org/) CDR essentially based on SQL that exposes its services *via* a REST API.

EtherCIS is a truly query-able openEHR CDR; meaning that a wealth of integration capabilities are enabled in 
a secure way at DB level:

- import/export of clinical data under various formats (SOAP, CSV, JSON etc.)
- integration with third party reporting applications (Jasper, BI etc.)
- direct feed from wearables, high throughput data feeds etc.
- Indexing specific value points (f.e. blood pressure values)

More documentation about the concepts and architecture of EtherCIS is located [here](http://docs.ethercis.org/)

Please also have a look to our [roadmap](https://github.com/ethercis/ethercis/blob/master/ethercis-roadmap.md) for more details

What's new?
-----------

- Security
	- JWT authentication
	- SSL between EtherCIS and clients (NB. postgresql SSL will be done in a next release)
	- Discretionary Access Control (DAC), multi-tenancy

- AQL enhancements
	- Querying list of items is now supported (f.e. list of allergies)
	- Node name/value predicate
	- 'Smart' type casting of returned items (f.e. value points as Real, Integer etc.)

- Template data cache: this is now done (partly) at DB level and speed up various operations in particular AQL optimization. 

- REST endpoint now supports much more configuration parameters including SSL, HTTP, CORS, monitoring and logging.          

- Various fixes and enhancements (as expected :)) in particular on Template introspection and RAW Json formatting. Important third party libraries have been upgraded ([jOOQ](https://www.jooq.org/) 3.10, [Jetty](https://www.eclipse.org/jetty/) 9.4.10 and XmlBeans 2.6.0). EtherCIS libraries (Uber jars) have been cleaned up significantly. Also improved or fixed many jUnit tests.

- Please note that we are now exclusively using Maven. Gradle was nice to try but we don't have any resources to deal with multiple build strategies. If you are a Gradle aficionado please feel free to contribute!

Building EtherCIS
=====

To build the set of required libraries to run an EtherCIS server instance, you need to compile 3 sets of components:

- [openehr-java-libs](https://github.com/ethercis/openehr-java-libs) these are the low level openEHR RM/AM classes
used to represent the abstract [openEHR RM model](http://www.openehr.org/releases/trunk/UML/)
- [ehrservice](https://github.com/ethercis/ehrservice) this layer binds the persistence to the RM model including dealing
with templates etc. This is the actual core layer of the architecture
- [VirtualEhr](https://github.com/ethercis/VirtualEhr) is the projection of the core layer in services. Currently this
provides a REST API as described [here](http://docs.ethercis.org/APIs.html)

- You need to compile each module as indicated in their respective README (mvn clean install, this assumes a local 
PostgreSQL 10 install with the test database loaded). 
A global setting for the assembly of *uber* jars should be done in your `settings.xml`. 

Project Structure
---
To allow various deployment and integration, the project is partitioned in two parts:

- core components: this part deals with OpenEhr object handling, serialization, deserialization, knowledge management and persistence
- service wrappers: this part encapsulate core components into a service framework with a REST API and JMX instrumentalization.

**Core Components**

The core modules are located in the repository [ehrservice](https://github.com/ethercis/ehrservice):

- core: fundamental operations and encoding of OpenEhr entities
- ehrdao: persistence of OpenEhr entities using a mixed model (relational/NoSql)
- knowledge-cache: caching of OpenEhr knowledge models (operational templates in particular)
- aql-processor: two passes SQL translation and query execution
- jooq-pg: utility module, binds ethercis table to jOOQ/Postgresql 9.4
- transform is mainly used to deal with raw json
- validation is responsible to check data input in relation to an openEHR template
- webtemplate implements template introspection
- db is used to perform DB configuration, upgrade and initial table loading in the case of a first install

**Service Wrappers**

The services and framework are located in [VirtualEhr](https://github.com/ethercis/VirtualEhr)

- `ServiceManager` service management framework
- `VEhrService` Query gateway of a running server instance
- `ResourceAccessService` a common service to access external resources (DB, knowledge etc.)
- `PartyIdentifiedService` wrapper to interact with OpenEhr PartyIdentified entities
- `LogonService` controls user login/logout and sessions
- `AuthenticationService` wrap a security policy provider
- `CacheKnowledgeService` wrapper of knowledge-cache to allow user queries
- `EhrService` deals with user queries on OpenEhr Ehr and Ehr Status objects
- `CompositionService` deals with user queries on Composition objects
- `QueryService` supports AQL/SQL querying

Please refer to the respective component's README for more details on the above

**Database**

EtherCIS requires PostgreSQL 10+.

The database is based on bi-temporal tables keeping records history. 
See [pgsql_ehr.ddl](https://github.com/ethercis/ehrservice/blob/remote-github/ehrdao/resources/ddls/pgsql_ehr.ddl) 
for more details on the actual structure and triggers.

The DB can be generated by running the above ddl script. DB `ethercis` should exist.

Tables TERRITORY, LANGUAGE and CONCEPT should be populated from openEHR local terminology definition contained in `terminology.xml`. 
Script `populate-concept` is provided to perform this task (see [ethercis/examples/scripts](https://github.com/ethercis/ethercis/tree/master/examples))

###### Required PostgreSQL extensions

</table>
</body>
</html>

## Upgrading from 1.1.2 to 1.2.0

1. File `services.properties` needs to be upgraded to use the new features. An example is given in the code base [here](https://github.com/ethercis/VirtualEhr/blob/master/VEhrService/src/test/resources/config/services.properties).
2. (this step is not required if you are building the application) Table TEMPLATE must be altered to support the fields used by the meta data cache. To do it, run the script in db migration [here](https://github.com/ethercis/ehrservice/blob/remote-github/db/src/main/resources/db/migration/V7_meta_cache.sql). 
3. AQL requires some more DB functions. These can be created by running the migration script [here](https://github.com/ethercis/ehrservice/blob/remote-github/db/src/main/resources/db/migration/v6_aql_v1_2_0.sql). 
4. Finally, make sure your launch script `ecis-server` references the new libraries.

## How To Run It?

- Script `ecis-server` should be adapted to get the right classpath, path to required configuration, network parameters etc.
- Ditto for all configuration files.

Script `ecis-server` uses *uber* jars to keep the modularity of the platform as well as to ease the production of patches. 
The jars are posted at [libraries](https://github.com/ethercis/ethercis/tree/master/libraries) until a better file repository is identified.

Documentation And Examples
-

In this section you will find:

- [examples](https://github.com/ethercis/ethercis/tree/master/examples) scripts and configuration files to run ethercis on a Linux box. Scripts can be adapted to launch the server on  Windows if required.
- [libraries](https://github.com/ethercis/ethercis/tree/master/libraries) some pre-compiled libraries to make life a bit easier (mostly xml bindings classes and one to avoid conflicts with the patches from the core module
- [installation](https://github.com/ethercis/ethercis/tree/master/installation) documentation and readme's, mostly to install a system
- [REST API](https://github.com/ethercis/ethercis/blob/master/doc/rest%20api.md) and [FLAT JSON](https://github.com/ethercis/ethercis/blob/master/doc/flat%20json.md)

- DAC + row level security (RLS)

v1.1.2 (Apr 10 2018)
--------------------
This version merges Sheref's PR to allow CI using Travis.

There are several changes including:

- Tests are more or less operational but nevertheless work is needed to make them more meaningful (as well as coverage). To disable the tests, set maven skip test flag to ```true``` in the respective POMs:

            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
                <version>2.19</version>
                <configuration>
                    <skipTests>true</skipTests>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>

- This version now uses PostgreSQL v10+. This is due mainly to better support returning compositions from AQL under
a (canonical) JSON format. PostgreSQL 10 comes with interesting jsonb functions that makes this part easier since 
JSON encoding can be partially done at DB level (NB. in the future this encoding shall be totally performed at DB level). The corresponding DB functions are in a flyway migration [script](https://github.com/ethercis/ehrservice/blob/remote-github/db/src/main/resources/db/migration/V5__raw_json_encoding.sql)
which can be run manually

- To run the tests, it is expected that a DB is installed locally and contains test data. The test data can be restored
from a [backup file](https://github.com/ethercis/VirtualEhr/blob/master/file_repo/db_test/testdb-pg10.backup). The restore
can be done using PGAdmin4 (since we use PostgreSQL 10). An easy way to proceed is to CASCADE DELETE schema 'ehr' and perform the restore using pg_restore as described in this [document](https://github.com/ethercis/ethercis/blob/master/doc/DB%20administration.md). Please note that the referential integrity trigger must be disabled. 

The DB installation can be done using the script found [here](https://github.com/ethercis/deploy-n-scripts/blob/master/ethercis-install/v1.1.0/install-db.sh). The install process is described in the [deploy-n-scripts](https://github.com/ethercis/deploy-n-scripts) section.


Spring-is-almost-there Edition Feb 2018
---------------------------------------

##### Changes in library structure

Few changes in the Uber jar generation to remove pesky dependencies on, yet-to-be-removed, org.openehr legacy classes. This has an impact on the classpath of the launch script to hold few more jars not included into the Uber jars anymore. Please note this will be modified soon as we are migrating to a continuous integration framework with Docker image generation.

The changes consists in the following classpath addition in ecis-server script:

```
${APPLIB}/CompositionTemplate.jar:\
${APPLIB}/openEHR.v1.Template.jar:\
${APPLIB}/composition_xml.jar:\
${APPLIB}/openEHR.v1.OperationalTemplate.jar
```
The above libraries have been added to lib/application repository.

The main repository lib/deploy is updated with the latest changes.

##### Operational Template Introspection (CR #74)

A new feature now support OPT introspection. Useful to automate some client UI construct or others. 
It is also opening the door to further data analytics potential as introspection results can be used to further support complex DB queries. 
See documentation in [OPT introspection](https://github.com/ethercis/ethercis/blob/master/doc/OPT%20introspection.md "OPT introspection")

##### Full template querying returning a JSON object (CR #73)

This changes allows to get a whole composition from a template in JSON format. 

To integrate this feature, a number of steps are required:

- Migration of PostgreSQL to at least 9.6 (10 is recommended)
- Installation of the functions supporting JSON encoding at DB level. A script is provided to help in this process. 
See in [resources/raw_json_encoding](https://github.com/ethercis/ehrservice/tree/remote-github/db/src/main/resources/raw_json_encoding)

In the future, we plan to support most of encoding/retrieval/querying at DB level only (by-passing most of the middleware logic) for performance reason.

##### Multiple fixes and enhancements

Please see the list of closed/in-test CRs for more details.
